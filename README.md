Sprint Review and Retrospective-


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are very important and inherently linked to the desired outcome of the software. User needs are high level needs, broad in scope and timeless.
User needs are the primary outcome of discovery in user research, user needs do not suggest a specific solution, and are normally written by the user researcher in the team. User stories, on the other hand, are written by the developer team that is led by the product owner, and not normally by the user researcher as user researchers’ job is not to specify solutions, rather present user needs and insights. User stories can be created from analytics, user feedback and hypothesis, not just from user research, and then followed up with subsequent user research. User stories gain detail over time and are split into epics if they are too large.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I can develop software programs using the following methods, Waterfall Approach in which the software development activities move to the next phase only after the activities in the current phase are over. However, like is the case with a waterfall, I cannot return to the previous stage. The Incremental Approach, where the first build incorporates a part of the total planned capabilities, the next build adds more capabilities, and so on, until the entire system is complete. The Spiral Approach, the iterative nature allows for knowledge gained during early passes to inform subsequent passes. Requires low up-front commitment. The Agile approach, which 
involves adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding of the problems to be solved. I will be incorporating all aspects of the agile framework in my future development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good Agile team-member possesses the qualities of: 
Unified Outlook
Accountability & Continuous Improvement
Value-Driven Development
Multi-Level Planning
Ability to Adapt New Way of Doing Things
Accepts and Works On Basis of Continuous Feedback
Structure & Creativity Comfort
Relative Estimation

The most successful teams are agile teams, not just in software development, but in almost every field of life. (Mehta, 2021)
